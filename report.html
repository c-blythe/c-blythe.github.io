    <p>What the app does:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Trivia</li>
        <li class="sub-li">The app will randomly generate a question</li>
        <li class="sub-li">When getting a new question, it can be modified by category and difficulty</li>
        <li class="sub-li">The user is presented with the answers as buttons</li>
        <li class="sub-li">When an incorrect button is clicked, the speaking entity will say it is incorrect before resaying the question</li>
        <li class="sub-li">When the correct button is clicked, the speaking entity will say that, and say a new question</li>
        <li>Cowsay</li>
        <li class="sub-li">The trivia text is formatted through the Cowsay API, which makes it look like a cow said it</li>
        <li class="sub-li">The speaking entity, both the one asking the questions and the one responding</li>
        <li class="sub-li">This is done through the dropdowns, which both default to 'Cow'</li>
        <li>Trivia</li>
        <li class="sub-li">Every trivia question that is given is logged in an array</li>
        <li class="sub-li">The search bar can be used to search through and filter through the array</li>
        <li class="sub-li">Any word can be searched, and if the question has it, it will be returned</li>
        <li class="sub-li">Additionally, keywords, preceded by a '!', can be used as well</li>
        <li class="sub-li">These keywords provide additional filters to the search</li>
        <li class="sub-li">For example, the search '!solved' will return every solved question</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <span>How the app satisfies requirements:</span>
    <ul>
        <li>The app is deployed publicly (as per the link above)</li>
        <li>The screen width affects the placement of the buttons and selections</li>
        <li>The OpenTriviaDB API and Cowsay API are used in conjunction with each other</li>
        <li>A search for past trivia questions is given</li>
        <li>These search results are displayed below the searchbar</li>
        <li>Certain keywords (e.g. 'solved') can be used to filter the results</li>
    </ul>
